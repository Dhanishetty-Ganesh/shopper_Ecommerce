Shopper is a responsive full e-commerce website built using React. This documentation provides an overview of the project structure, components, and functionalities.

### App.js

`App.js` is the main file of the React application. It utilizes the React Router library for client-side routing. The application defines various routes for different pages, including:

- Home page
- About page
- Shop page
- Contact page
- Login page
- Signup page
- Forgot password page
- Cart page
- Checkout page
- Blog page
- Product details page

The main component, `App`, renders the application and utilizes `BrowserRouter` to set up routing and `Routes` to define different routes. Each route is defined using the `Route` component, specifying the URL path and the corresponding component to render.

The `Layout` component is a common wrapper rendered around each page, containing elements such as header, footer, and navigation menu.

`ScrollToTop` is a custom component used to scroll to the top of the page when navigating to a new page.

The `ShopContext` component serves as a custom context for sharing data between different components.

### Home.js

`Home.js` is a React component responsible for rendering the home page of the website. It includes sections for featured products, repair services, new arrivals, hot deals, blogs, and a newsletter subscription form. The component utilizes various React components such as `FeaturedProducts`, `NewArrivals`, and `Newsletter`, along with importing images and blog posts for the respective sections.

## React Library

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, characterized by its declarative and component-based approach.

### Declarative

React simplifies the creation of interactive UIs by allowing developers to design simple views for each state in the application. It efficiently updates and renders components as data changes, making code more predictable, understandable, and easier to debug.

### Component-Based

React encourages building encapsulated components that manage their own state, allowing developers to compose complex UIs by combining these components. Since component logic is written in JavaScript, data can be easily passed through the app while keeping the state out of the DOM.

### Learn Once, Write Anywhere

React's flexibility enables developers to write code that can be used across different platforms, including web, server-side rendering with Node.js, and mobile apps with React Native.


### Installation

- Use Online Playgrounds for quick experimentation with React.
- Add React to a website via `<script>` tag or through npm for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.
